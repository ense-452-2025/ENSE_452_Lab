## ENSE 452 - Embedded and Real-Time Software Systems - Laboratory

# Lab 1: Introduction to the hardware and software tools

### University of Regina
### Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science - Software Systems Engineering

### Lab Instructor: [Trevor Douglas](mailto:trevor.douglas@uregina.ca)

## Introduction

Introduce the students to some of the ARM architecture. Begin using the lab tools. The students will create a project and write an assembly program based on a simulated target.

## Background

Many documents are available on urcourses, under Class Resources in the ARM STMicro Docs folder.  Some of the most useful are listed below. There may be updated versions of these documents available online, which you are welcome to substitute.

- STM32CubeIDEUserManual: UM2609
-  STM32 Programmer's Manual: PM0056
-  STM32 Reference Manual: RM0008
-  Nucleo Board Schematic: MB1136
-  STM32 HAL User Manual: UM1850
-  STM32F103RB Data Sheet

Our target board is the Nucleo-64, and it has a lot of fun peripherals. The brain of this board is a STMicro STM32F103RB microcontroller, with 128 KiB of Flash, and 20 KiB of RAM and a 72MHz clock.
